\section{Introduction}
%A short introduction to what you have done.
This is an auction system, where different clients bid on a auction, managed by servers.

\section{Architecture}
% A description of the architecture of the system and the protocol (behaviour), including any protocols used internally between nodes of the system.
We have made an auction-system using Active replication. In this instance, we have a client/front-end that communicates to all the available servers (the replication managers in this instance).

\section{Correctness 1}
%Argue whether your implementation satisfies linearisability or sequential consistency (after precisely defining  the property it satisfies).

\section{Correctness 2}
%An argument that your protocol is correct in the absence and the presence of failures.
